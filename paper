\begin{abstract}
We measure stellar metallicity and abundance gradients for a sample of red 
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Because the survey does not 
have multiple spectra at various radii in a single galaxy, we measure 
gradients statistically. Galaxies are split into stellar mass bins and then 
stacked 
in redshift bins. Statistical gradients are calculated by subtracting the 
measured absorption line values in neighboring redshift bins to determine the 
equivalent widths of metallicity and age indicators for multiple stacked 
annuli of a given stellar mass bin. After determining the indicators, we use 
stellar 
population modeling implemented by the EZ\_Ages code to calculate age and 
metallicities at each annulus and then determine a gradient. We repeat this 
analysis with binning by velocity dispersion instead of mass to check for potential 
errors in the stellar mass calculation. Our data covers the
central regions of these galaxies, out to approximately $1 R_{e}$. We find 
that 
existing gradients in abundances and metallicities
are quite shallow, and only minorly dependent on stellar mass, and that our large 
age 
determination uncertainty strongly affects our ability to accurately find 
any gradients. We compare our results to direct measures of gradients and 
central values in 
individual galaxies as well as theoretical predictions, and we find that our 
results are nearly completely consistent with both.

\section{Introduction}

The study of stellar population and metallicity gradients has been an ongoing 
topic as it places relatively strong constraints on the evolutionary history 
of galaxies. Events such as mergers (and the properties of galaxies prior to 
merging) can drastically change the distribution of stars in the final 
galaxies, effecting the observed metallicity gradients dramatically as well 
\citep{dimatteo09a}. Equally, a lack of mergers can lead to an evolution of a 
metallicity gradient after the infall of cooling gas \citep{pipino10a}. 
Predicting the observed stellar metallicity gradients correctly requires a 
model of the star formation and formation history (mergers or otherwise) of 
galaxies. This suggests that a large-scale study of metallicity gradients in 
elliptical galaxies may help our understanding of the average path an 
elliptical galaxy takes in formation --- how many mergers, mass ratios of the 
mergers, when star formation bursts occur, and how long these formation bursts 
last, among many properties.

Equally, observing metallicity gradients in a large sample of galaxies has 
been a challenge, as it requires high-resolution spectra of multiple regions 
of the same galaxy. Usually, then, observational studies that attempt to 
constrain theoretical models are restricted to a relatively small number of 
nearby galaxies \citep{greene13a, spolaor10a, kuntschner10a, rawle10a, 
pastorello14a}, which limits their predictive 
power. Here, we plan on studying a large number of galaxies observed by SDSS 
and instead of finding metallicity gradients in individual galaxies, averaging 
galaxies in redshift bins and calculating statistical gradients between annuli 
found by subtracting galaxy fluxes at different radii from each other. 

We begin by selecting a sample of non-starforming galaxies in SDSS, the 
process of which is detailed in Section \ref{sec:sampleselect}. We measure 
the standard Lick indicies used to calculate age and metallicity, and make 
use of EZ\_AGES \citep{graves08a} to obtain those parameters. With our sample 
complete, we compare our calculated gradients to several other studies in 
Section \ref{sec:obs} to verify the accuracy of our approach, focusing on 
studies that also are able to find gradients in the inner $1 R_{e}$ of 
galaxies rather than ones
that examine the full outer regions as well. We then examine 
several papers that discuss theoretical models for the formation of these 
galaxies to see which our observations support and what, if any, conclusions 
we can draw about likely evolutionary histories of our galaxies in Section 
\ref{sec:theory}. 

With this larger data set, we hope to be able to see if we can match 
theoretical models that will then tell us more detail about the formation 
histories of these SDSS elliptical galaxies and place constraints on how 
these galaxies must have evolved.

\section{Sample Selection}

\label{sec:sampleselect}

Our sample is composed of a subset of the NYU-VAGC \citep{blanton05a}. This 
catalog contains 686,356 objects with recorded spectra and several extracted
values from the observations (redshift, a half-light radius, magnitudes in 
several bands, and an estimate of the stellar mass). The stellar mass we use
is k-corrected [MORE FROM RENBIN].

We wish to select a uniform sample of non-starforming galaxies so that we can 
have confidence that the properties remain relatively the same across the 
entire redshift range of our study and avoid any emission line contamination 
of the features we seek to measure. To do this, we perform a 
few simple cuts involving [OII] and H$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EWs) as 
previously done in \cite{yan06a} that yield cuts in spectroscopic properties. 
First, objects that have [OII] emission but no H$\alpha$ are kept 
in the sample. Second, any object with neither [OII] nor H$\alpha$ recorded 
is kept. Finally, for objects with both [OII] and H$\alpha$, we keep ones 
with a high ratio of [OII]/$H\alpha$ and reject those with a low ratio. We 
define this ratio as \cite{yan06a} does $(EW([OII]) > 5 EW(H\alpha) - 7)$ 
and we keep all objects that pass this ratio of those with both lines 
detected. These cuts may potentially exclude some red, non-starforming 
galaxies as the cost of being sure the number of blue, starforming galaxies 
remaining in the sample is very low (approximately 3\% per \citealt{yan06a}).

This leaves us with 266,195 non-starforming galaxies to work with. The next 
set of cuts is to ensure that the data remaining has correctly recorded 
results for all the important parameters that we will need. We remove all 
objects with masses less than $10^{7}$ and all objects that do not have 
recorded EWs for the metal lines (Mg b, Fe5270, Fe5335, Ca4227, and C4668) 
that we will be using, as well as H$\beta$, which tends to happen only in the 
rare case of a badly fit absorption line. This is a relatively minor 
adjustment and only reduces our sample by approximately 4\%.

Finally, metallicities are dependent on the stellar masses of the galaxies, and so we 
break up the data into mass bins, each individually volume limited, the 
details of which are given in Table \ref{table:massbins}. The galaxies are also divided
into velocity dispersion bins, but the number of bins and volume limiting cuts in
redshift and magnitude remain unchanged.

\end{figure}

In preparation for Lick index measurement, we must make two adjustments to our
spectra. The first is a resolution correction --- as \cite{zhu10a} notes when
performing the same corrections, SDSS spectra are not at the same resolution
at which the originally defined Lick indicies were observed. \cite{schiavon07a}
contains several tables (Table 43-46, depending on galaxy age) in which corrections 
for a given velocity dispersion to
the Lick IDS resolution are defined, but these are empirical corrections and
so to at least standardize the error, we smooth all galaxies in our sample to
the same velocity dispersion of $325 km s^{-1}$. Any errors in this
resolution correction will thus at least be the same for every galaxy, hopefully
ensuring that any gradient trends we report will be independent of these
errors. We use the table of corrections for a 7.9 gyear population, noting that while 
some of our galaxies will be older and some younger, the differences are only a few 
percent for corrections of a different stellar population age. The second correction, 
also defined by \cite{schiavon07a}, is a fluxing
correction to bring the SDSS spectra in line with the Lick IDS system. It too
is empirical, with potentially large error, but we apply this correction after each 
Lick index is recorded to fully bring our results in line with the Lick IDS system,
noting unfortunately that errors from these corrections cannot be included in
our error budget as well.

Each object that is kept in the sample then has its Lick indices for Mg b, 
Fe 5335, Fe 5270, Ca 4227, C 4668, and H$\beta$ measured. In addition to the 
Lick index, we also measure the absorption line flux and continuum values 
directly over the same wavelength range. We also measure the [OIII] line flux 
to correct for H$\beta$ line infill due to emission (see \citealt{zhu10a, 
trager00a, mehlert00a} for some discussion on the process and difficulties 
behind this correction). We use the standard correction factor of 
$\Delta$EW H$\beta = 0.6 EW([OIII])$ that these prior works settle on with the 
understanding that it is empirical and has relatively large scatter, instead 
of attempting a correction where we would directly adjust the flux (instead of 
the equivalent width) of the H$\beta$ absorption based on the measured flux of 
the [OIII] emission. In this 
[OIII] line fitting, we ignore any lines that are weak detections (defined as 
indistinguishable from zero line flux or line width at the one sigma level), 
and simply do not correct H$\beta$ for those objects.

We convert several other of the above measured Lick indices to more commonly 
used combinations in calculations of metallicity as well. First we compute 
$\mathrm{[MgFe]'=\sqrt{Mg b \times (0.72 Fe5270 + 0.28 Fe5335)}}$, and 
secondly we compute $\mathrm{\langle Fe\rangle = (Fe5270 + Fe5335) / 2}$. Both 
these combinations are chosen because they more directly correlate with 
metallicity than any single Lick index \citep{thomas03a}. This gives us 5 
metallicity indicators ($\mathrm{[MgFe]'}$, $\mathrm{\langle Fe\rangle}$, Mg 
b, Ca 4227, C 4668) and one age-related indicator (corrected H$\beta$) for 
each of our galaxies that we will analyze.

\section{Data Analysis and Procedures}
\label{sec:dataanalysis}

SDSS does not have many spectra of multiple parts of individual galaxies to 
study how the metallicity varies as a function of radius in a single object. 
SDSS has a constant 3 arcsecond fiber. Thus, observing a galaxy at a low 
redshift will measure the metallicity in a smaller aperture around the center 
of the galaxy than a galaxy observed at higher redshift. This approach 
mirrors that of \cite{yan12a}, who measured emission lines. Here, we are 
attempting to localize the absorption lines by stacking galaxies and computing 
the values in question in annuli of the galaxies.

Each stellar mass bin is handled separately. Within each stellar mass bin, the objects 
are divided up into redshift bins with the goal of having the maximal number 
of bins without having any span too large a redshift range or contain too few 
objects for statistical power. We need to balance the concern of flattening 
the true gradient by having too few bins (see discussion in \citealt{yuan13a}) 
with the concern that too many bins will cause differentials between bins to 
be too small to be observed with our uncertainty being on the same order of 
magnitude as the actual changes. We tested many binning choices and find that 
changes to the binning choices have minimal impact in the determination of the 
gradients, indicating that our results are relatively robust.

Once the stellar mass bins are subdivided into redshift bins, we compute the average 
value for the line and continuum luminosity of each metallicity indicator recorded 
above for all the galaxies falling into that bin. For details of this sample's
 binning, see Table \ref{table:binning}.

We then can compute the Lick index for an annulus by calculating

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\frac{line luminosity_{zbin 1} - line luminosity_{zbin 2}}{continuum luminosity_{zbin 1} - continuum luminosity_{zbin 2}}}
\label{eqn:ew_annulus}
\end{equation}
for adjacent redshift bins zbin 1 and zbin 2. Knowing the redshift of each 
object in a redshift bin and the SDSS aperture size (3 arcseconds diameter), 
we can then compute the average redshift of each galaxy in a bin and then 
convert that to a physical radius assuming standard cosmology ($H_{0}=70 
km/s/Mpc$, $\Omega_{M}=0.3$, $\mathrm{\Omega_{total}}=1$). A radius 
is then assigned to each annulus by taking the midpoint of the two redshift 
bins' physical radii that the annulus is computed from. Thus, we are left 
with the pairs of points (Lick index, physical radius) for each stellar mass bin, 
which is plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:data_gradient} to measure a gradient. The 
one exception to this is the innermost point --- this one is
not an annulus but rather just the innermost redshift bin, and it is assigned
a radius of half its maximum extent. One important detail that results from
treating the innermost bin this way and binning in equal-redshift spacings is
that the innermost redshift bin in each mass bin has a very large amount of
impact on the gradient calculations --- it not only is used twice (once in the
difference between bins 1 and 2 and once by itself as the innermost point), but
it covers the largest range of radius and has the smallest number of objects of
all the redshift bins in that stellar mass bin. Any errors that exist in that bin, 
therefore, will have a much larger impact on our final results. Finally,
because our annuli are no longer fully independent of each other, there should
be a nonzero off-diagonal values in the covariance matrix. We neglect these
terms and only consider the variance in plotting error bars for each point.

This analysis is repeated identically, but replacing stellar mass with velocity
dispersion in the initial step. We perform this step mainly for confirmation that
our derived masses are accurate, but also so that we can more directly compare
the results we find to papers that only report a velocity dispersion as a proxy
for mass. Below we will present the results for both binning schemes, but as will
be seen there are only a small number of differences.

In addition, we also calculate an average galaxy radius for each stellar mass bin 
using the average elliptical mass-radius relation discussed in several papers 
(\citealt{chiosi12a, shen03a}, among others). For high-mass ellipticals such 
as our sample here, the relation is approximately $\log{R_{1/2}} = 
0.54\log{M/M_{*}} - 5.25$. For the stellar mass value, we use the average stellar 
mass in each stellar mass bin. As mentioned in those papers, this half-mass radius is 
not strictly identical to the effective radius $R_{e}$ but is usually quite 
close. In this paper we will use $R_{1/2}$ as a proxy for $R_{e}$ in 
comparison to other works and refer to it as $R_{e}$ only from now on. This 
will allow for better comparison to theoretical works later in this paper.

With the values computed for the various metallicity indicators in each 
annulus, we chose to use EZ\_Ages \citep{graves08a} to compute the actual 
metallicities as well as several other parameters. EZ\_Ages uses iterative 
fitting of the stellar population models described in \cite{schiavon07a} to 
determine the best-fit metallicity and age from the Lick indices we have 
recorded. We applied EZ\_Ages to the stacked annuli, not the individual 
objects. We use solar isochrones and a Salpeter initial mass function with 
exponent 1.35 as inputs for all galaxies. Changing to $\alpha$-enhanced 
isochrones was tested with minimal impact on the overall results, although a 
small number of points no longer fit on the age-metallicity grid. The results
of the EZ\_Ages fitting is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ezages_gradient}. With 
metallicities computed, we perform linear regression to compute the gradient 
for each stellar mass and velocity dispersion bin separately.

\section{Results}

Our results are shown in the 8 figures below. The first four (Figures 
\ref{fig:data_gradient}, \ref{fig:ezages_gradient}, \ref{fig:data_gradient_rre}, and 
\ref{fig:ezages_gradient_rre}) are the results based on the stellar mass binning approach.
The second four (Figures \ref{fig:data_gradient_sigma}, \ref{fig:ezages_gradient_sigma}, 
\ref{fig:data_gradient_rre_sigma}, and \ref{fig:ezages_gradient_rre_sigma}) are the results
based on the velocity dispersion binning approach. The lines plotted in all eight are the 
linear fitting results shown in Table \ref{table:gradients} and Table 
\ref{table:gradients_re} (for stellar mass binning) and Table \ref{table:gradients_sigma} 
and Table \ref{table:gradients_re_sigma} (for velocity dispersion binning) where the exact 
values are listed for more precise comparisons. The units are dex $\mathrm{kpc^{-1}}$ in 
radius.

One note is that we found a systematic mis-measurement of the H $\beta$ line
in the $10.7 < \log{M} < 11.0$ mass bin, due to part of 
the redshift range it covers.
The H $\beta$ line for one of the points is redshifted on top of the 
OI 5577 sky line, and often incorrectly (and dramatically) increases the 
flux measured in the line. This leads to a too-large H $\beta$ line, and 
a too-young age, as well as a slight increase in [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] for 
that one point. This point is left on all plots, but not used in the fits,
and is tinted a slightly lighter red in color to indicate the presence of 
bad data. This issue is not as clearly present in the velocity dispersion 
binning due to a wider redshift coverage per bin causing the bad data to 
be covered up by the averaging of enough good points, so no masking is used.

There is a wide range of important conclusions to draw from these data. Before 
moving to the analysis, it's worth simply listing some of the notable facts.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item All the metallicity indicators show a negative gradient when plotted
    both versus physical radius and $R/R_{e}$.
    \item All the measured indicator gradients as a function of physical 
    radius tend to flatten with increased stellar mass.
    \item Nearly all the trends are detected with high significance.
    \item The calculated ages as a function of radius has very large scatter, 
    with ages ranging from 2 to 12 billion years.
    \item The gradients for [Fe/H] and [C/Fe] are generally declining, while the gradient 
    for [Mg/Fe] is generally flat. 
    \item Theere is a slight increase in the central value of [C/Fe], while the central 
    [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] values are nearly constant.
    \item There are no extreme differences between the results from the stellar
    mass binning and the velocity dispersion binning.
\end{enumerate}

What looks likely from these results is that we can determine metallicities 
rather well, but due to the uncertainty in our H$\beta$ measurements, our age 
determinations have a large amount of scatter. Some of the H$\beta$ 
uncertainty is driven by the inherent scatter in the [OIII] correction to 
H$\beta$ line infill, some results from the extra difficulty in measuring two 
lines (instead of one) precisely, and some results from the expected slight 
differences amongst these galaxies that will add some scatter to our points 
as well. Due to the lack of trend we find in the age points, we do not fit 
these data points linearly --- they are simply shown with error bars at each 
radius.

We can also see that our stellar masses and velocity dispersions correlate very closely,
as they should. We will use both interchangably for comparison to prior works, depending
on what data the paper in question offers, as our conclusions are the same regardless.

If we consider the $R/R_{e}$ plots (Figures \ref{fig:data_gradient_rre}, 
\ref{fig:ezages_gradient_rre}, \ref{fig:data_gradient_rre_sigma}, 
\ref{fig:ezages_gradient_rre_sigma}; values given in Table \ref{table:gradients_re} 
and \ref{table:gradients_re_sigma}), we also find that stellar mass or velocity dispersion 
only influences the fitted gradients slightly --- the [Fe/H] plot shows a steadily 
increasingly negative central metallicity as stellar mass increases, but the 
gradient stays mostly constant (contrary to expectations, although similar 
to recent findings in \citealt{pastorello14a}). This trend in 
central metallicities is loosely reflected in the $\mathrm{[MgFe]'}$ and 
$\mathrm{\langle Fe\rangle}$ plots as well, as would be expected. Other metals 
such as [C/Fe] and the indicators C 4668 and Mg b show no clear dependencies 
on stellar mass in gradient or central values, however.

Finally, we calculate logarithmic gradients for [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [C/Fe] for each
stellar mass and velocity dispersion bin. These results are shown in Figures
\ref{fig:massgrad} and \ref{fig:massgrad_sigma}, with the plotted values given in
Tables \ref{table:loggrads} and \ref{table:loggrads_sigma}. We find in general very
little dependence of the gradients on either mass or velocity dispersion. The only
exceptions are a very small trend towards flattening gradients in [Fe/H] as a function
of velocity dispersion, and the lowest mass bin gradient of ]Fe/H] as a function of
mass which is much steeper than the others.

\section{Comparison to Previous Observational Studies}
\label{sec:obs}

We essentially have three main results being tested: the gradients for the
EZ\_AGES outputs ([Fe/H], [C/Fe], and age), the trend in their central values with 
mass, and the trend in their gradients with mass. Each of these have been studied in
other papers and give us a basis to check our data with.

Some of the papers we will examine do not use the same stellar population models --- 
they instead use the very slightly different models from \cite{thomas03a} (TMB).
These models differ slightly in the outputs they produce, with the TMB models
giving [Z/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] instead of the EZ\_AGES output of [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [C/Fe]. 
Fortunately, \cite{thomas03a} proposes a conversion between the two measures of 
[Fe/H] = [Z/H] - 0.94[$\alpha$/Fe], which we will use to compare our observations to 
those papers that use the TMB models. For the $\alpha$-elements, the TMB models assume
that all $\alpha$-elements track Mg, so we can compare our [Mg/Fe] to the [$\alpha$/Fe]
values. [C/Fe] will have no analog in those cases.


\subsection{Gradients}

We begin with \cite{greene13a}, who study 33 nearby galaxies and measures similar 
metallicity indicators to our survey, also using EZ\_Ages to convert the data into 
physical parameters. They observe a much larger extent of the galaxies than we do,
out to about 14 kpc, but they do have data in the innermost portions for us to
compare to. They find a [Fe/H] gradient of around -0.3 to -0.5 dex $\mathrm{kpc^{-1}}$, 
slightly steeper than
ours, with the exception of the lowest velocity dispersion bin.
However, their findings for [Mg/Fe] and [C/Fe] mirror ours quite closely, with
a constant [Mg/Fe] gradient in both velocity dispersion bins like all four of ours,
and a [C/Fe] gradient of around -0.1 to -0.2 dex $\mathrm{kpc^{-1}}$ 
like our data shows as well.

Some of the [Fe/H] discrepency may be explained by the differing radial coverage.
\cite{greene13a} observes a much larger radius, which gives a chance for gradients
to steepen in the outskirts.

A similar study by \cite{mehlert03a} studied the metallicity gradients in of 
early-type galaxies in the Coma Cluster using the data from in 
\cite{mehlert00a}. Rather than using EZ\_Ages to model the metallicity and
age, they use the model in \cite{thomas03a}, with the differences discussed above.

The results in \cite{mehlert03a} mirror \cite{greene13a} in finding a 
declining [Fe/H] and constant age and [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient. We can calcuate 
similar logarithmic index gradients (per Equation 5 in \citealt{mehlert03a}, given 
in Table \ref{table:loggrads}) to compare the values of the metallicity indicators in 
our stacked annuli to their results. However, they cover a much smaller range in radius,
only out to about $0.1 R_{e}$, which is a more central region that our objects as well.
Their [Fe/H] gradient is much shallower than the results in \cite{greene13a}, as they
only examine the central area --- it matches our data nearly exactly, with a gradient
of around -0.1 to -0.2 dex.

We also compare our results to the study in \cite{spolaor10a}, where 
14 low-mass ellipticals in the Forrnax and Virgo clusters were examined in 
detail and compared to several higher mass ellipticals from previous studies. 
The results are measured in similar form to \cite{mehlert03a}, also using the 
models of \cite{thomas03a}, with similar results of a declining [Fe/H] ($-0.22\pm0.14 dex^{-1}$ 
averaged across all mass bins) and roughly constant [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient, in agreement 
with our results as well. Importantly as well, \cite{spolaor10a} reports data out to
between 1 and 3 effective radii, almost perfectly in line with the range we cover as well.

Finally, we also consider two studies of the gradients in inner regions of
galaxies: \cite{rawle10a} and \cite{kuntschner10a}. Both these studies record
metallicity values out to $1 R_{e}$, making their coverage of galaxies
similar to ours, although both only calculate a [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio (which
tracks Mg) and not a [C/Fe] ratio. Both studies find a slightly negative
metallictity gradient, matching our observations --- \cite{rawle10a} finds
an average gradient of $-0.13 \pm 0.04 dex^{-1}$ and \cite{kuntschner10a} finds an
average gradient of $-0.25 \pm 0.11 dex^{-1}$, with values ranging from -0.1 to -0.5
much like our results and other studies. Also in agreement with our observations,
\cite{kuntschner10a} report an [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient consistent with zero.

 
\subsection{Trend in central values with mass}

We next turn to trends in the central values. The galaxies in \cite{greene13a} show 
an increase in central metallicity with mass at a fixed radius, while our galaxies predict
a nearly constant value of the central metallicity. Our trends with mass agree in the 
[C/Fe] ratio, with both reflecting a slight increase in central values with stellar mass, 
and also the central [Mg/Fe] ratio with both \cite{greene13a} and our results finding it 
to be roughly constant. It is important to note
that our central values are measured around the 0.3 kpc mark while the innermost
data point for \cite{greene13a} is around 2 kpc, meaning that we are likely not comparing
the same portions of the galaxies here. That being said, this trend with mass persists
across all radii in our survey (with the exception of the lowest mass or velocity 
dispersion bin), so if we instead compared our data points at 2 kpc to those in 
\cite{greene13a}, we would draw essentially the same conclusions.

\cite{mehlert03a} report central values for [Z/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] as a function of 
mass as well. They find an increasing [Z/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe], which corresponds 
(with their reported values) to a slightly increasing [Fe/H] and an increasing [Mg/Fe]. 
Our nearly constant central [Fe/H] shows some potential (but very minor) evidence for
an increase with mass, so while we disagree with their result, large error bars may be
masking agreement in part; in addition, we do find that the lowest mass bin (see Fig. 
\ref{fig:ezages_gradient}) does have a smaller value of [Fe/H] so while the overall 
trend is constant, there is some evidence for an increase with mass.

\subsection{Trend in gradients with mass}

For trends in gradients with stellar mass of these measured values, we mostly find 
agreement with \cite{greene13a}. Three of the four of our calculated metallicity gradients 
are very 
close to constant within error as stellar mass increases, as found by \cite{greene13a} 
as well, with the only exception being the lowest stellar mass bin. It's important to
note the one discrepency between the stellar mass binning and the velocity dispersion
binning here --- in the velocity dispersion binning, there is no outlier in the lowest
velocity dispersion bin. This reinforces the agreement with \cite{greene13a} of finding
constant gradients as a function of mass, as there is extra uncertainty added in deriving
the stellar masses that may impact the binning. Figs. \ref{fig:massgrad} or 
\ref{fig:massgrad_sigma} show these trends with stellar mass and velocity dispersion in 
more detail. Similarly for [Mg/Fe] and [C/Fe], we find no definitve trends in the
gradients as a function of mass or velocity dispersion, which is the same as 
\cite{greene13a}.

\cite{spolaor10a} does 
cover enough of a stellar mass range to check for any mass dependency of these 
gradients, and does find a slight steepening of the metallicity gradient as 
stellar mass increases for high-mass ellipticals, although the scatter increases as 
well. As will be discussed more in the theory section, this
scatter is attributed to the wide variety of merger histories available to
high-mass ellipticals \citep{dimatteo09a}, leading to a wide variety of 
potential final, observed gradients. As the lowest velocity dispersion bin in
the sample of \cite{spolaor10a} is only overlapping with our lowest mass bin, and
the three higher mass bins in our sample are all lumped together into a single high
velocity dispersion bin in \cite{spolaor10a}, we find some slight evidence for
the opposite trend (a flattening gradient), although the scatter is rather large. 
More encouragingly, the bins that overlap most completely (covering a range of velocity
dispersions $2.1 < \log{\sigma} < 2.6$) have very similar recorded gradients 
(-0.23 $dex^{-1}$ in \cite{spolaor10a} and -0.2 to -0.3 $dex^{-1}$ in our sample).

Both \cite{rawle10a} and \cite{kuntschner10a} find
similar results to most of the previously discussed studies: a large amount
of scatter, and evidence for a varied evolutionary path of these galaxies.
However, \cite{kuntschner10a} does notice a slight trend that is partially
reflected in our data. At low masses, \cite{kuntschner10a} reports an increasingly
negative metallicity gradient (up to about $3.5 \times 10^{10}$ solar masses), followed
by a turnover and flattening metallicity gradient as mass increases further. We
have far fewer points to use to determine trends with mass, but our lowest-mass
point is indeed the steepest gradient, with all higher-mass ones showing
some evidence of flattening out (see Figs. \ref{fig:massgrad} and \ref{fig:massgrad_sigma}, 
and Tables \ref{table:loggrads} and \ref{table:loggrads_sigma}). 
However the granularity of our data prevents
us from checking in detail at which mass we find this turnover to be at to
further compare to the observations in \cite{kuntschner10a}.

Realistically, the large error bars present in the determination of the metallicity 
gradients prevent us from concluding anything too firm; we mostly can say that it
appears that the gradient very slightly flattens with stellar mass or velocity dispersion, 
and is close to constant above a certain stellar mass or velocity dispersion cutoff around 
$3 \times 10^{10}$ solar masses, which is not in disagreement with any of the studies 
we found.

\subsection{General conclusions}

To sum up the wide variety of comparisons presented, we begin with the similarities. 
There is good agreement with finding a negative [Fe/H] gradient, a constant [Mg/Fe], 
and a very slightly negative [C/Fe] gradient, even if the numerical results presented have a fairly 
large amount of scatter. For trends in central values as mass (or velocity dispersion) 
increases, we find agreement with a constant central [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H], and increasing
central [C/Fe].

Finally, we find that we in general agree with the trends in gradients of [Fe/H] with
mass as well --- with a steeper gradient in the lowest mass objects, and then a flatter 
although still negative gradient for higher mass galaxies, with the gradient leveling 
out to be roughly constant with mass. [Mg/Fe] shows agreement here as 
well, with no real trends reported with mass in the gradients.

We also do not see the dramatic increase in scatter as shown in 
\cite{kuntschner10a} and others in our [Fe/H] gradient as we increase mass, which 
theory also predicts, although our error bars are rather large to begin with, perhaps
masking the natural scatter present.

\section{Comparison to Theory}
\label{sec:theory}

Many papers have modeled various galaxy evolution features, and in general 
they have found that mergers tend to flatten gradients and monolithic collapse 
models tend to steepen them \citep{pipino10a, dimatteo09a}. Because in reality 
both mergers and collapse effects are occuring, the predicted results lie 
along a continuum of flat to steep gradients, with substantial scatter amongst 
the observations due to differing degrees of these two effects for each 
individual galaxy \citep{pipino10a}. Thus we do not expect perfect agreement 
with any individual models but rather that our data lie somewhere in between 
results reported by merger-focused simulations and monolithic collapse-focused 
simulations. 

When comparing our gradient values to those in \cite{hopkins09a}, who 
simulated merger models, we find general agreement. Most of their metallicity 
gradients are between -0.1 and -0.6 dex, while our results (shown in Table 
\ref{table:loggrads}) are around -0.1 to -0.4 dex. Similar conclusions are 
drawn by \cite{kobayashi03a} who finds gradients in the range of -0.2 to 
-0.8 dex. \cite{kobayashi03a} simulates both merging and monolithically 
collapsing galaxies, and it is important to note that within the spread of the 
results, our data agrees with both sets. \cite{dimatteo09a} handles mergers in 
more detail than most simulations, recording gradients that result from 
various mass ratios and various initial metallicity gradients of merging 
galaxies. The results again show metallicity gradients of about -0.1 to -0.4 
dex, but are dependent on the type of mergers that have occurred to form the 
final galaxies as expected. As we do not know the merger history of the 
galaxies we observed, all we can conclude is that for reasonable initial 
metallicity gradients and merger histories, our results again are in agreement 
with the simulations of \cite{dimatteo09a}.

Another interesting property to investigate is if trends with stellar mass exist. Our 
results (see Fig. \ref{fig:massgrad}) suggest that all three gradients are 
roughly constant with stellar mass, with perhaps a slightly flattening [Fe/H] depending
on how much the lowest stellar mass bin is believed. Simulations give varied results 
depending on the merger history of 
the galaxies, with \cite{dimatteo09a} noting methods that can give rise to both
flatter and steeper gradients depending on the stellar masses of merging galaxies and 
their initial gradients, and thus proposing that little trend should exist 
overall but scatter should increase. Other models predict no clear trend and 
increasing scatter as well (see \citealt{pipino10a, kobayashi03a}). Some models
do predict a correlation \citep{kawata03a}, but only take into account
hierarchical collapse and not the interplay of mergers as well. In general, 
though, the conclusions are broadly suggestive that metallicity gradients 
should slightly steepen with increasing stellar mass, albeit with increased scatter as 
well \citep{ogando05a} due to higher stellar mass galaxies being allowed a larger 
variety of possible evolution paths that will change how their gradients 
develop. We find no clear trend in [Fe/H] gradient with stellar mass, however there is
some support for a very slight steepening in the three higher stellar mass bins. This,
however, is not reflected by the velocity dispersion binning, which show (if any trend)
the opposite one of a flattening gradient. Thus we can only really conclude that
the scatter is indeed large but cannot really report evidence for or against a
clear trend with stellar mass. The
error bars in our results are largely driven by statistical considerations
based on the number of objects in each stellar mass bin, so we are unable to
detect any potential real scatter in the data that may exist due to our method.

The potential for many types of mergers and the differing gradients that
result from the different stellar mass ratios and initial metallicity gradients of the
progenitors as discussed in detail in \cite{dimatteo09a} make it difficult to
conclude definitively if our observations agree with theory as simply adjusting
the progenitor properties within reasonable values can change the model
predictions dramatically. To make a more detailed comparison of our results to 
theory would require modeling expected merger rates and stellar mass ratios to see if 
our observations require extreme properties there. However, for now, we can 
conclude that our results do not indicate any clear disagreements --- the 
gradients we find are within the ranges predicted by models that incorporate 
both monolithic collapse and mergers of many types into the evolution of 
elliptical galaxies, and our gradients follow a generally observed trend with 
stellar mass.

\section{Conclusions}

With such a wide variety of potential histories to produce the galaxies we 
observed in SDSS, it's unsurprising that we find potential agreement with most 
studies and models. However it's important to note that we arrived at these 
results by averaging thousands of ellipticals that could have had many 
different histories, not observing single galaxies like most observational 
studies to this point. Equally important is that we find agreement both in 
individual gradients and in trends with stellar mass. Small differences that do exist 
may arise because of dependence on correlated properties 
(our higher stellar mass galaxies are also by necessity of a volume limited sample 
at higher redshift, for example), or it may be a real effect of having a much 
larger observational sample that explores a larger amount of `galaxy evolution 
space'.

Our gradients in metallicity are similar but on the whole slightly shallower, 
while our [Mg/Fe] gradient matches all the compared studies by being flat. In 
terms of stellar mass dependence, we see a flattening of metallicity gradients as mass 
increases in line with the compared studies. We find fairly similar central 
values for [$\alpha$/Fe] (although slightly smaller), and also observe an 
increase in central [$\alpha$/Fe] with stellar mass as the other studies do. Our
metallicity also matches the studies we compared to, both in
values and trends with mass.

In total, we find that using this new technique to find the 
metallicity inside an annulus of averaged galaxies agrees nearly completely 
with both observations of individual galaxies and simulated predictions of 
galaxies that have formed from mergers and/or monolithic collapse. This
technique may make it easier in the future to observe higher redshift 
metallicity gradients as telescopes do not need to be able to resolve 
multiple regions of the same object, just to take a single spectra of many 
objects over a wide redshift range.
